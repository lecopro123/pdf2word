PDF to Word Converter

This project is a lightweight document management utility that makes it easy to open/edit Word documents, manage multiple PDFs as appendices, reorder them visually, and convert/export the final output in a clean and intuitive interface.

Key Features

-> Word File Handling

    Open existing Word documents or create new ones.

    Status indicator with a colored dot (●) and a descriptive label shows whether a Word file is active.

-> PDF Appendix Management

    Select multiple PDF files to add as appendices.

    Each PDF is displayed as a stack card with:

      File name and page count.

      Buttons for Move Up, Move Down, and Delete, with hover effects and spacing for a clean look.

    Users can reorder PDFs interactively, ensuring the final document respects their intended order.

-> Conversion Workflow

    Once configured, the Convert button processes the active Word document and integrates the selected PDFs.

    A dialog box confirmation informs the user when the conversion is complete.

    A Clear button allows resetting all appendices and status labels.

-> Polished GUI Design

    Minimalistic, card-like stack frames with soft gray borders.

    Hover effects for better interactivity.

    Buttons aligned neatly at the center with consistent sizing.
